# FileEncrypter
We have a lot of data in our desktop that we wish that only we can read.
To protect these data, we came to implement this idea. So to overcome this, we thought we can make a file encrypter. 
This software will encrypt the file with a password and can only be decrypted with that password

Run the mainDialog.py with a python compiler or you can download the setup for the given link:
